# PokeStats

> An awesome React/Redux application that displays the stats of a specific Pokemon. 
> You can filter through the list of Pokemon and see the stats of the Pokemon you choose.
> It is builded using the Single Page App (SPA) structure that allows users to:
    - See a filtered list of pokemons by their Types.
    - See stats of each pokemon once you click on each one of them.
    - Enjoy a relaxing music of Pokemon Center in the background.
    - If you are a developer, try to look for the easter egg that allows you to display music controls.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Click on the top right green "code" button.
- On the dropdown menu, choose "download with zip" button.
- After download, extract the zip file and you have the project on your machine.
- After downloading run `npm i` to install all Node packages.
- Run `npm start` to run the project.

## Test

- After cloning the project you need to run these commands
  > `npm install`
  > This command will download all the dependancies of the project.

As this project counts with css and javascript, you will need to test the following:
- For tracking linter errors in CSS or SASS  files run:
  > `npx stylelint "\*_/_.{css,scss}"`
- And for tracking linter errors in JavaScript files run:
  > `npx eslint .`
Or you can use this command if you want to just automatically solve the linter errors:
  > `npm run fixlinters`

At least, use the following command to run all the tests:
  > `npm test`
and after that it will prompt you to an interactive window where you have to select:
  > `Press a` 
And that should be it.
